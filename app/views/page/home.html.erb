<h1>Preface--What are cancers in common?</h1>
<p>Cancer genome is notorious for its highly varied types of chromosome changes, which include but not limit to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), chromosome loss/gain, copy number variation (CNV), and translocation. These complicated genetic alterations make it extremely hard to extract meaningful data from the chaos, which is further complicated by differences in individual cancer types. Decades of effort have been made in order to find a solution to this headachy and life-threatening disease. However, all therapies advanced so far--including tranditional non-specific methods like chemo-therapy, radiation treatment, and target-specific strategies like angiogenesis inhibitor or even gene therapy--shows little or very limited effect. This disappointing truth is largely caused by the highly varied nature of cancers. <b>Experiences tell us that the solution to any complex problems is by first figuring out the law/rule behind those complex phenomena.</b> This has been proven in the field of mathematics, physics, medical science.... We believe it is also applicable here to the problem of cancer.</p>
<p>Different from what you may have seen in other articles on this topic. Here we are not discussing cancers' common properties at "High level", like they all are loss of control in replication (immortal), all have the potential to move around the body (metastasis). We are not even discussing some so-called common genetic characteristics, like they all show some kinds of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952507003848">chromosome instability (CIN)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_heterozygosity">LOH</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_number_variation">CNV<a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation">translocation</a>.... Because, obviously, they indeed have those properties, but unlukily all of those properties show very different patterns across different cancer types, or different between individuals on same kind of cancer, or even between same kind of cancer cells in one individual.</p>

<h1>Do cancers have any common features?</h1>
<p>So, is there any real common thing that we can say sure about cancers? With the high throughput microarray data on 60 cancer cell lines (covered 6 different types of tissue) from National Cancer Institue (NCI) (<%=link_to("learn about NCI-60 cancer cell lines",'/page/nci60')%>), and with <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/abouthapmap.html.en">HapMap Causacian healthy samples</a> (30 trio families), after systematic analysis, we indeed noticed a common feature of cancers' genome--an <b>extremely similar runs of homozygosity (ROH) pattern (differ only in strength) between cancer and normal samples.</b> It seems that the massive ROH found in cancer cells stems largely from the continuation of existing ROH in healthy state. We propose this highly rhythmic aspect of cancers may help us understand the nature of human genome and how it changes during tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>Most people might not be familiar with the term "ROH". You can follow the link here to <%=link_to("learn about Runs Of Homozygosity (ROH) and ROH Frequency (ROHF)",'/page/roh')%>. Generally, ROH region in diploid organism means a genomic region with extended length of homozygous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">Single Nucleotide Polymorphism</a> (SNP)s. It is a sign of low sequence diversity between maternal and paternal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid">chromatid<a>. While ROH is used to describe SNP status of single individual, ROHF describes ROH status of a population. It represents the proportion of samples with ROH on specific SNP locus. Using Affymetrix 500K SNP array, we scanned the whole genome of each of the NCI-60 cell lines to get their SNP data. These data were then used to deduce the whole genome ROH status of each cell line, which were then used to calculate ROHF. Same operation was done for HapMap Caucasian healthy sample (N=90). The amazing result is shown in Figure 1</p>

<p>Now let me explain a little bit about the picture above. It gives us a general view of the ROHF pattern on 22 autosomes and sex chromosomes. For each chromosome, the left most lane is the ROHF of NCI-60 cancer samples. The second lane is the ROHF of HapMap Caucasian samples. (I will introduce the two lanes on the right later.) What we see is an extremely similar ROHF pattern between cancer and normal samples (<%=link_to "Tabulated here",'page/tablesone'%>). The only difference is that the ROHF is much higher in cancer samples (approx. 11 fold). Another noteworthy observation is that in heathy samples the ROHF is not equally distributed. For those regions where we see a relatively higher ROHF in healthy sample, we can usually see an even higher ROHF in cancer samples. To statistically prove this point, a stepwise increasing cutoff was applied on HapMap ROHF and the result is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here we see that on population level if a region has low ROHF in healthy state, it is less likely to develop high ROHF in cancer state. However, if a region has a middle to higher level of ROHF in healthy state, it is very likely to retain the ROHF or develop an even higher level of ROHF in cancer state. In short, that is, if "the bad guy" is not there, it is unlikely that he will be there later. But once he is there, more and more "bad guys" will be there!. When comes to individual level, this reflects the extension of existing ROH to a wider range (I will explain this point later).</p>

<p>It is very important to notice that the cancer samples used here totally have no relationship with those HapMap healthy samples. They were collected from different participants live in different places, at different times, by different researchers from different labs. This totally excluded the possibile sample contamination not rarely seen in cancer researches involving germ-line matched control. Moreover, rather than rely on single type of cancer, the cancer samples here covered 60 different cancer cell lines for 6 kinds of tissue--a really meaningless mixture as you may think at first glance. Thus excluded the potential bias caused by the unique genetic construct of a specific type of cancer. The only concordances are that both sample groups are Caucasian, and that both were analzyed on same kind of microarray platform (Affymetrix 500K)(We actually also investigated the ROH pattern of HapMap sample tested on 100K array and found the same pattern). These stunning truthes tell us that what we see here may represent a general property of human cancer genome.</p>

<h1>Is it age related?</h1>
<p>We can do more with current data in hand. As you have seen in the second section, the HapMap healthy samples are actually 30 trio families. This means it i composed of 60 parents (adult) and 30 children (young). It would be interesting to ask "Is there any difference between adult and young groups on their ROHF". Moreover, if a higher age is related to more ROH, we should see higher ROHF in the adult group. This hypothesis was confirmed by our careful statistical analysis (number of adult was shrunked to 30 by 1000 random sampling to match with young number). The adult group has an average ROHF of 3.41% and the young group is 3.35%. This 0.06% difference was shown to be significant in both paired and non-paired t-test after Bonferroni correction (p<1.1e-10). Among the 1000 randomly generated adult sample groups, 747(743) show significant difference from young group, and 72.9%(92.3%) of those significant datasets have higher ROHF than young [number calculated from ROH deduced by HMM and PLINK(in parentheses)]. However, here I have to admit that this small difference makes the story somewhat less convincing. Anyway, it is easy to obtain small P-value with large sample size, especially for microarrays with usually 0.5-1 million SNPs. At this scale of sample size, aim-less data mining is a dangerous behavior that exposes highly to false positive result. Nevertheless, the analysis here is based well on several biological discoveries. One is done by <a href="#ref2">Moragoda et al.</a> who described age-associated stomach mucosa LOH among healthy people over 60 year of age. Another a a review from <a href="#ref1">Carr, L. L. et al.</a> who described several evidences of age-related LOH in both human and model organisms. All these findings persuade us to believe the above small but significant difference is not observed by chance and is from biological consequence.</p>

<p>Despite of these evidences, it is still not scientifically sound to say "it is age related". Because what we have here is a categorical variable (either "adult" or "young"). We also don't know whether it is caused by other factors, like diseases or epigenetic changes that were not considered here.</p>


<h1>How does that happen?</h1>    
<p>So what can explain the formation of ROH regions? The first that comes to our mind might be natural mutation. Sincerely, if several mutations occured in close vicinity and happen to result in heterozygotes-&rsaquo;homozygotes change, a new ROH region may take form. However, this is highly impossible because the rate of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_rate">natural mutation</a> is extremely low (~1.1×10<sup>-8</sup>) in human genome. Another machanism is mitotic recombination, which we think is the most reasonable explanation.</p>

	</tr>

<p>Figure 3 illustrated the mitotic recombination process where two heterozygotes changed to homozygotes in progeny. Rather than purely start form scratch, the chance of mitotic recombination is positively correlated with the sequence similarity between paternal and maternal chromatids. Studies in <a href="#ref3">E. coli</a>, <a href="#ref4">Trypanosoma brucei</a>, and <a href="#ref5">mouse</a> show the importance of extended sequence similarity/diversity in promoting/preventing homologous recombination. This mechanism is now very commonly used in biopharmacy industry where a target gene can be transfected into host bacteria through recombination. Based on these evidences, we come up with a figure to illustrate how ROH may extend.</p>

	<tr>

	  <td width="400px" valign="top"><p>In figure 4, blue and pink chromatids are from father and mother respectively. Brown regions are homozygotes region where the paternal and maternal chromatids are identical(or highly similar) to each other. The short gap is a small region with heterozygotes. The mitotic recombination, if happened over the two ROH regions next to each other, will change the heterozygotes gap in parental cell to homozygotes in progenies. In reality, the ROH extension mechanism may not be limited to the one shown here. However, no matter how it may happen, the final result is that its progenies will be homozygous on that region forever. It is like a "One-way" ticket because from nowhere can its progenies restore the heterozygotes (except very rare cases like natural mutation). The mechanism here can explain what we saw in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, where a stronger ROHF correlation was found between cancers and healthy sample on regions that already show ROH in healty sample.</p>

<p>Beside the extension from existing ROH region, other mechanisms may also explain the formation of high ROHF region. Among many possible explanations, we found that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_fragile_site">fragile site</a> (FRA) plays an important role here. Generally, FRAs are composed of AT-rich sequence, which was thought to form flexible peak that tends to form a gap or constriction and may tend to break during chromosome replication. A list of known FRA on human genome is available from the <a href="www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/hgnc_stats.pl">HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee</a> (HGNC). From the FRA cytogenic locations provided in HGNC database we reconstructed the FRA locations which are shown in the 4th lane in figure 1. Below is a zoomed view of chromosome 14 with NCI-60 (1st lane), HapMap ROHF (2nd lane) patterns and FRA locations (4th lane).</p>

	  <td>chromosome 14 illustrated the co-occurance between FRA location and high ROHF band. For the two FRA sites (B and C) on Chr 14, we observed a lower level of ROHF in healthy samples and a higher (and also wider) ROHF in NCI-60. However, at the whole genome scale numerous FRAs do not have associated ROH band. Thus FRA obviouly can explain only a limitied part of ROH formation. The 3rd lane shows the location of known miRNA. However, we found no relationship between miRNA and ROH region.</td>

<h1>Pathways enriched in the highest ROHF difference region</h1>
<p>It would be interesting to find out what biological pathways were involved in the regions that show highest difference between cancer and normal samples. To do this, we submitted the SNP probe ids to GeneGO, a webtool for pathway analysis. Result shows that G1_S cell cycle process ranked first. The genes that show high ROHF difference in this process were listed below</p>

<p>Here we noticed the involvement of several onco-related genes like Claspin and P53. Claspin is required for cell replication checkpoint control. P53 is a well-known protein that is in charge of the apoptosis. Unluckily, we can not show you here how the ROHF change may quantitatively/qualitatively affect these genes. </p>

<h1>Implications</h1>
<p>Before we can draw a conclusion on these observations, an important question to answer is the causal relationship between homozygotes accumulation and oncogenesis. Since cancer cell has potentially more replication cycles that exposes its genome to more mitotic recombination events, a likely ratiocination is homozygotes accumulation comes after cancer formation. If this is true, any studies aim to uncover "cancer related mutations" need to be very careful of their cancer samples. If the cancer sample used for study is very "old"--several generations after the founder cancer cell--then most of the identified mutations may largely represent a result of mitotic recombination. Thus in order to find those canonical cancer-causing mutations, an ideal way is to spot the cancer founder cell, or if it's too hard, dissect the cancer tissue at its very begining stage.</p>  
<p>The story on the opposite side is that homozygotes accumulation caused cancer. Of course, those homozygotes can not be built up in one night. Thus a reasonable story is that due to some reason there is an accelerated formation of homozygotes (most likely a result of higher speed or larger range of mitotic recombination), and finally the change in quantity leads to change in quality(cancer). In this scenario, we should seriously rethink what is the real cause of cancer. Driven by the common idea that unfavorable mutations on "onco-gene" (or tumor suppressor gene) are responsible for tumorigenesis, most researches today focus on genomic regions that harbor gene information, or gene regulatory elements. This gene-specific approach can help us discover genes that are associated with cancer. This, however, also confined our view to "genes", which in this spectrum looks more like a consequence (victim) of anormal recombination events. For some reasons, these events start from certain positions and spread out the whole genome. The affected regions, if covered onco-related genes in an unfavorable manner, will convey neoplastic effect. This process, rather than randomly starts from scratch, may depend highly on existing homozygotes in healthy state. One important thing to note is that no matter where and how the homozygotes may accumulate, a prerequisite is that the cell must be replication active. This may partly explain why cells that were thought incapable of undergoing mitosis rarely develop cancer. Like cardiac myocytes, nerve cells, and skeletal muscle cells.</p>
<p>All these imply that human are generally born imperfect. Regions born with high level of homozygosity are more likely to extend the homozygosity, which in our study seems to be highly associated with tumorigenesis. Problems remain as what triggered the mass recombination events, as well as whether it is a cause, or result of cancer because of potentially more replication cycles.</p>
